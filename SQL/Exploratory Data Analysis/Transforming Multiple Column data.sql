/*
Create an "other" category
If we want to summarize Evanston 311 requests by zip code, it would be useful to group all of the low frequency zip codes together in an "other" category.

Which of the following values, when substituted for ??? in the query, would give the result below?

Query:

SELECT CASE WHEN zipcount < ??? THEN 'other'
       ELSE zip
       END AS zip_recoded,
       sum(zipcount) AS zipsum
  FROM (SELECT zip, count(*) AS zipcount
          FROM evanston311
         GROUP BY zip) AS fullcounts
 GROUP BY zip_recoded
 ORDER BY zipsum DESC;
Result:

zip_recoded    zipsum
60201          19054
60202          11165
null           5528
other          429
60208          255
*/

SELECT CASE WHEN zipcount < 100 THEN 'other'
       ELSE zip
       END AS zip_recoded,
       sum(zipcount) AS zipsum
  FROM (SELECT zip, count(*) AS zipcount
          FROM evanston311
         GROUP BY zip) AS fullcounts
 GROUP BY zip_recoded
 ORDER BY zipsum DESC;

/*                                  Group and recode values
There are almost 150 distinct values of evanston311.category. But some of these categories are 
similar, with the form "Main Category - Details". We can get a better sense of what requests are
 common if we aggregate by the main category.

To do this, create a temporary table recode mapping distinct category values to new, s
tandardized values. Make the standardized values the part of the category before a dash ('-').
 Extract this value with the split_part() function:

split_part(string text, delimiter text, field int)
You'll also need to do some additional cleanup of a few cases that don't fit this pattern.

Then the evanston311 table can be joined to recode to group requests by the new standardized 
category values.*/

--#1 Create recode with a standardized column; use split_part() and then rtrim() to remove any
--      remaining whitespace on the result of split_part().

--#2 UPDATE standardized values LIKE 'Trash%Cart' to 'Trash Cart'.
--   UPDATE standardized values of 'Snow Removal/Concerns' and 'Snow/Ice/Hazard Removal' to 'Snow Removal'.

--UPDATE recode by setting standardized values of 'THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVEâ€¦Trash Cart', 
--       '(DO NOT USE) Water Bill', 'DO NOT USE Trash', and 'NO LONGER IN USE' to 'UNUSED'.



DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;
CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS
  SELECT DISTINCT category, 
         rtrim(split_part(category, '-', 1)) AS standardized
  FROM evanston311;
UPDATE recode SET standardized='Trash Cart' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart';
UPDATE recode SET standardized='Snow Removal' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
UPDATE recode SET standardized='UNUSED' 
 WHERE standardized IN ('THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVE...Trash Cart', 
               '(DO NOT USE) Water Bill',
               'DO NOT USE Trash', 'NO LONGER IN USE');

-- Select the recoded categories and the count of each
SELECT standardized, COUNT(*)
-- From the original table and table with recoded values
  FROM evanston311 
       LEFT JOIN recode 
       -- What column do they have in common?
       ON evanston311.category=recode.category
 -- What do you need to group by to count?
 GROUP BY standardized
 -- Display the most common val values first
 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

```                 Create a table with indicator variables
Determine whether medium and high priority requests in the evanston311 data are more likely to contain requesters' contact information: an email address or phone number.

    Emails contain an @.
    Phone numbers have the pattern of three characters, dash, three characters, dash, four characters. For example: 555-555-1212.
Use LIKE to match these patterns. Remember % matches any number of characters (even 0), and _ matches a single character. Enclosing a pattern in % (i.e. before and after your pattern) allows you to locate it within other text.

For example, '%___.com%'would allow you to search for a reference to a website with the top-level domain '.com' and at least three characters preceding it.

Create and store indicator variables for email and phone in a temporary table. LIKE produces True or False as a result, but casting a boolean (True or False) as an integer converts True to 1 and False to 0. This makes the values easier to summarize later.```

-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS indicators;

-- Create the temp table
CREATE TEMP TABLE indicators AS
  SELECT id, 
         CAST (description LIKE '%@%' AS integer) AS email,
         CAST (description LIKE '%___-___-____%' AS integer) AS phone 
    FROM evanston311;
  
-- Select the column you'll group by
SELECT priority,
       -- Compute the proportion of rows with each indicator
       sum(email)/count(*)::numeric AS email_prop, 
       sum(phone)/count(*)::numeric AS phone_prop
  -- Tables to select from
  FROM evanston311
       LEFT JOIN indicators
       -- Joining condition
       ON evanston311.id=indicators.id
 -- What are you grouping by?
 GROUP BY priority;
