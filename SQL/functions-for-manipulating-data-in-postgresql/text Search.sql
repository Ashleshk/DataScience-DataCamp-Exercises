```Measuring similarity between two strings
Now that you have enabled the fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm extensions you can begin to explore their capabilities. First, we will measure the similarity between the title and description from the film table of the Sakila database.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the film title and description.
Calculate the similarity between the title and description.```


-- Select the title and description columns
SELECT 
  title, 
  description, 
  -- Calculate the similarity
 similarity(title, description)
FROM 
  film

```Levenshtein distance examples
Now let's take a closer look at how we can use the levenshtein function to match strings against text data. If you recall, the levenshtein distance represents the number of edits required to convert one string to another string being compared.

In a search application or when performing data analysis on any data that contains manual user input, you will always want to account for typos or incorrect spellings. The levenshtein function provides a great method for performing this task. In this exercise, we will perform a query against the film table using a search string with a misspelling and use the results from levenshtein to determine a match. Let's check it out.

    Select the film title and film description.
    Calculate the levenshtein distance for the film title with the string JET NEIGHBOR.```

-- Select the title and description columns
SELECT  
  title, 
  description, 
  -- Calculate the levenshtein distance
  levenshtein(title, 'JET NEIGHBOR') AS distance
FROM 
  film
ORDER BY 3

```
Select the title and description for all DVDs from the film table.
Perform a full-text search by converting the description to a tsvector and match it to the phrase 'Astounding & Drama' using a tsquery in the WHERE clause.```
-- Select the title and description columns
SELECT  
  title, 
  description 
FROM 
  film
WHERE 
  -- Match "Astounding Drama" in the description
  to_tsvector(description) @@ 
  to_tsquery('Astounding & Drama');

  
```
Add a new column that calculates the similarity of the description with the phrase 'Astounding Drama'.
Sort the results by the new similarity column in descending order.```

SELECT 
  title, 
  description, 
  -- Calculate the similarity
  similarity(description, 'Astounding Drama')
FROM 
  film 
WHERE 
  to_tsvector(description) @@ 
  to_tsquery('Astounding & Drama') 
ORDER BY 
	similarity(description, 'Astounding Drama') DESC;
