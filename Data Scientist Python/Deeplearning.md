2. how to answer Learner questions
* Start with something positive. You can kick start the conversation by saying thanks for your comment or pointing out that their topic is very interesting.

* Focus on the way you interpreted the post, rather than the way t they wrote it.

* Make it clear that you do not think they have done anything wrong and that you know they weren't trying to be offensive. Blame the situation instead of the person.

* If you can, show that you relate to them in some way and have misunderstood yourself in the past. We are only human and can also make the same mistakes.

* Finish with something positive.You can tell them how exciting this field is for you and how this topic is going to be important in their careers.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this discussion, Paul! I really appreciate it when people help me to see something from a different angle. 

I actually first thought that you were attacking me. Now, I know this was not the case, but that was the first thing that crossed my mind. Communicating concepts in writing can sometimes come off as offensive. Sometimes my fellow mentors feel offended when Iâ€™m actually trying to congratulate them for an awesome job!

So, glad we discussed it. Thank you!
