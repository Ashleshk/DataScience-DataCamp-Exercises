# DataScience-DataCamp-Exercises
you’ll learn how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data
all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, you’ll get hands-on with some of the most popular R packages, including ggplot2 and tidyverse packages like dplyr and readr. You’ll then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to write your own functions and perform cluster analysis. Start this track, grow your R skills, and begin your journey to becoming a confident data scientist.

# Data Camps


# 1. Data Analysis in SpreadSheets
* **Predefined functions**
    * This chapter introduces a very useful feature in Google Sheets: predefined functions. You'll use these functions to solve complex problems without having to worry about specific calculations. We’ll cover a lot of predefined functions, including functions for numbers, functions for strings, and functions for dates.
        * First function - ROUND
        * Function composition - SQRT
        * Functions and ranges - MIN, MAX
        * Selecting ranges - SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN
        * Multiple arguments - RANK
        * Even more arguments - RANK
        * String manipulation - LEFT, RIGHT
        * String information - LEN, SEARCH
        * Combining strings - CONCATENATE
        * Date functions - WEEKDAY
        * Comparing dates
        * Combining functions

* **Conditional functions and lookups**
    * In the last chapter of the course, you'll master more advanced functions like IF() and VLOOKUP(). Conditional and lookup functions won’t seem so scary after you completed this chapter.
        * Performance statistics
        * Flow control - IF
        * Nested logical functions - IF
        * Combining logical values - OR, WEEKDAY
        * Conditional counting - COUNTIF
        * Conditional aggregation - COUNTIF
        * Conditional sum - SUMIF
        * Conditional average - AVERAGEIF
        * Advanced conditions - AVERAGEIF
        * Filters - FILTER, DATEVALUE, MEDIAN
        * Grades in class
        * Automating the lookup - VLOOKUP
        * More about lookup - VLOOKUP
        * Horizontal lookup - HLOOKUP
        * Weighted average - SUMPRODUCT, HLOOKUP
