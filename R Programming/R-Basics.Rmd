Calculating the worldwide box office
The single most important thing for a movie in order to become an instant legend in Tinseltown is its worldwide box office figures.

To calculate the total box office revenue for the three Star Wars movies, you have to take the sum of the US revenue column and the non-US revenue column.

In R, the function rowSums() conveniently calculates the totals for each row of a matrix. This function creates a new vector:

rowSums(my_matrix)

```r
# Construct star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", 
                 "The Empire Strikes Back", 
                 "Return of the Jedi")
               
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, 
                      nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                      dimnames = list(titles, region))
star_wars_matrix
# Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)
```
## Adding a column 

You can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function, which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column. For example:

big_matrix <- cbind(matrix1, matrix2, vector1 ...)
